## Project requirements (Prioritisation using MoSCoW)





##	How I expected the challenge to go.

- I was confident in implementing the main concepts and deliverables required as part of the MVP. I anticipated some problems when it came to testing phase, however that process went smoothly.

## What went well? / What didn't go as planned?

Things that went well:
- Completed the deliverables checklist for the MVP
- Met > 50% of the stretch goals

Things that could have gone better:
- Implementing the rest of the stretch goals


## Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.

- Creating a Docker image of the application and deploying it to the cloud
- Hosting the database using a cloud provider
- Building a CI pipeline
- Creating a frond end for the application
- Creating a second table with a relationship
